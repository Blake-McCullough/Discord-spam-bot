# Discord-spam-bot
Simple spam bot for discord (I got bored)
`<3-square <word/ping>` will start to spam the word/ping 
`<3-stop` - Will stop any spamming

Spam's messages in the server (100 messages per command and can run multiple at once this is to deal with rate limiting, which may also cause the messages to slow down, however kill command, kills all.)
